# The 2016 NHL Playoffs on Twitter

This repository contains the ipython notebook used for analysis of 2016 NHL playoff twitter data along with the figures that were produced. The study spanned about 65 days and tweets had to be downloaded continuously due to twitter API restrictions. Furthermore, I made sure to leave enough time after the tweet was initially posted for it to garner favorites and retweets.

The analysis and results were documented in the following blog posts:
